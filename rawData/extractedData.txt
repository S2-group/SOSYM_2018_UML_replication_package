A UML virtual machine using FUMBeS is envisaged. It would simulate of the whole embedded and real-time system, i.e. the execution of its active objects and their concurrent execution, respecting the time constraints. In addition, a CASE tool to execute test cases upon the UML specification is also foreseen. This tool would allow the specification and automatic execution of test cases during the modeling phase. Thus, if any change in the UML model affects any behavior considered correct, the engineers would be warned about the problems.

Car Door Central Lock is a control system for locking and unlocking car doors.

The complete version checks whenever parcel jam occurs and prevents a parcel from being transfered from one chute to another one until it is empty. The simpli ed version ignores jams.The Rover system model [1] allows an autonomous robot to move through di erent directions. It is equipped with three wheels driven by two engines. It can move forward, move backwards, and rotate.The FailOver system [6, 23] is an implementation of the fail-over mechanism. It involves a set of servers processing client requests. "	synthetic # controller # mobile_robot # manufacturing # communication	Currently, instrumentation only applies to explicitly defined transitions. Since transitions from the history state to pos- sible target states are implicitly implemented, the current approach does not provide support for suspending the ex- ecution before the entry action code of a state when it is reached from the history state. The same limitation exists for exit code on sub-states during a group transition. Also, our current implementation only supports value change of primitive attributes.

In other words, the transformation pro- duces code which effectively represents what is defined in the model; if the model is not valid, then the transformation is not able to produce valid C++. An interesting direction that stems from the contribution presented in this work is to look into reverse engineering of C++ code (legacy or generated) to ALF for consistency assurance. An interesting enhancement of the translation process would be the possibility for the developer to configure the transformation through parameters in order to reach a specific result. An example of this could be the possibility to exploit different mechanisms for memory management and let the developer select the one to use when launching the transfor- mation. The transformation process has been designed in a way that should enable partial reuse of the code generator when targeting another object-oriented language. We have planned to add Java as target language for our code genera- tor. Doing so, we would be able to measure the actual effort needed for such an enhancement. Moreover, we have already started an effort towards direct compilation of UML and ALF, without intermediate translations to programming languages such as C++, to see to which extent we can preserve execution semantics of ALF in the generated executables."	F_code_optimization # F_execution_correctness # F_code_optimization # F_additional_target		P03	71	P4	N3	Ivano	A	ACM	N/A	N/A	A	A Model-Driven Engineering Methodology to Design Parallel and Distributed Embedded Systems	Andrea Enrici and Ludovic Apvrille and Renaud Pacalet	LTCI, CNRS, Telecom ParisTech, Universite _ Paris-Saclay, France 	ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES)	TODAES	2016	J	SPECIFIC	PARALLEL # SOC	N/A	T	YES	PROD # QUALITY # CORRECT	YES	NO	LOW	NO	SEQ # ACT # PACK # DEP # COMP	B # S	umlactions	NO	sysml # ADHOC	DIPLODOCUS_ADHOC	NO	PIM # PSM # HW	performance # adaptability	YES	java	NO	tml	dsl_model	NO	c_base # c++ # tml	2	NO	N/A	N/A	N/A	VALID	The effectiveness of our solution in terms of better design quality (e.g., portability, time) is demonstrated with the design of the physical layer of a ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) transmitter onto a multi-processor architecture.

Some aspects adaptation implementation have interfered in the project specification, e.g., DataFreshness reads signal value associated to an OUT port, but such a situation is forbidden in VHDL. To overcome this problem, this port type had to be changed to INOUT, so that this signal could be read internally within the entity. Other issue is related to the interference among aspect adaptations. For instance, a signal created in COPMonitoring had interfered the implementation created for DataFreshness, and hence, COPMonitoring implementation, i.e., its mapping rule scripts, had to be modified.Other issue is regarding the proposed UML-to-VHDL mapping rules. Such mapping rules have been created with the focus on keeping the high-level semantics of the UML model in the generated VHDL description, in order to facilitate the hardware/software co-design and design space exploration. This may be achieved by means of using distinct hardware and software mapping rules on the same source UML model. At the moment, this research has not evaluated the effect of different kinds of strategies for the generated VHDL implementation, e.g., optimizations for area or speed, keeping/flattening hierarchy, or using behavioral or structural description style. Therefore, the obtained FPGA slices utilization rate, as well as system performance, might be directly affected due to a distinct description strategy.Finally, it is important to mention that engineers skills may affect the results discussed in this paper. Engineers knowledge of UML or the application domain may impact the quality of the produced model, leading to inaccuracies in the discussed results. In addition, experience with AMoDE-RT, GenERTiCA as well as the chosen target platform may affect the wayengineers describe the mapping rules. Thus, trained engineers might create better mapping rules for a new target language, e.g., SystemC, Verilog, etc. # As future work, more case studies are already being performed. A similar analysis is going to be executed, in order to demonstrate the suitability and feasibility of using platform independent aspects to design FPGA-based embedded real-time systems. New rules for UML elements that are not yet covered will be defined as well, e.g., state machine diagrams and their relationship with sequence diagrams. In addition, other DERAF aspects need to be implemented in VHDL. However, for that, it is important to obtain or create a set of reusable soft IP components, in order to implement aspects adaptations using their services."	F_expressiveness # F_code_optimization # F_platform_improvement #  F_additional_evaluation		P05	79	P6	I1288	both	A	IEEE	N/A	N/A	A	On the Generation of Full-Fledged Code from UML Profiles and ALF for Complex Systems	"Ciccozzi, Federico ; Cicchetti, Antonio ; Sjodin, Mikael"	malardalen university	ITNG	ITNG	2015	C	SPECIFIC	RTES	N/A	T	NO	CORRECT # QUALITY # PROD	YES	NO	MEDIUM	NO	COMP # STRUCT # CLASS # DEP # SM	S # B	alf	NO	marte # chess_ADHOC	chess # papyrus	YES	PIM # PSM # HW	performance	YES	xpand # qvt	NO	NO	dsl_model	NO	c++	2	YES	N/A	N/A	N/A	EVAL	"The solution we propose in this paper has been validated against an industrial case-study [32] at Ericsson Nikola Tesla (Zagreb, Croatia) under the supervision of Ericsson AB (Stock- holm, Sweden).

Their orders are shown as bubbles inscribed by the order attribute meal, e.g. ÒMeal 1Ó. Animated actions are the entering of the drive-through, ordering, being served, eating and leav- ing the queue. The animated actions (and their graphical representations) are coupled to certain graph transfor- mation rules which evoke the corresponding operations. Other graph transformation rules (preparing the operation processing or checking conditions) are not relevant for the animation view. They will be still applied but their effect will not be visualized in a scenario animation.	business_process	Our approach supports basic state machine diagrams (protocol state ma- chines) without advanced features like nested states. # Future work is planned to cover still more selected lan- guage features from UML, especially considering the UML 2.0. Moreover, in complex cases the integration of various UML diagrams may lead to large graph transformation sys- tems which are difficult to handle and to understand. There- fore, for practical use, structuring concepts for graph trans- formation (see e.g. [18]) should be incorporated in the pre- sented approach, and also implemented in the tool AGG, which is the underlying graph transformation engine for both UGT and GENGED. Work is in progress to implement type graphs with inheritance and multiplicities as underly- ing language model in AGG, which should make it easier to go the step from a meta model description (a class di- agram) to the corresponding type graph for a UML based visual language.

The third artificial problem (AP3) is inspired by a train control gate system discussed in [76]. 	manufacturing # sensing # synthetic	"The focus of the work presented here was only on RTESwith soft time deadlines in the order of hundreds of milliseconds,with an accepted jitter of a few milliseconds. However,the modeling methodology proposed in this paper is independentof this limitation and can be used to model systemswith stricter deadlines. This limitation is due to the choiceof Java as a target language for simulation. The choice ofJava was made based on the needs of our industry partnersbut may obviously not be appropriate in other environments.To use the approach in the presence of stricter deadlines, apossible option is to use a virtual machine supporting RealTime Java (Java RT) (e.g., [70]) on a real-time operating system(e.g., [71]). We have not currently evaluated the practicalimplications of using Java RT, but the specificationsclaim that the standard java code is completely portable to aJava RT machine, which provides a precision in the order ofnanoseconds.One of the limitations of the proposed simulator generatoris that we still cannot be completely sure about its correctness.As discussed earlier, to test the simulator generator, wewrote a number of test cases by hand. We also ran the generatedsimulator with the testing engine to test faulty RTES(artificial problems and industrial cases) and were able totrigger failures on test cases revealing seeded faults withouttriggering failures that were unwarranted. This increased ourconfidence in the correctness of the transformation rules. Theevaluation of such transformations is still an open researchquestion [78] and no suitable tool for testing model to texttransformation is available yet.Based on the experiments that we ran [44] to test differenttypes of RTES (artificial problems and industrial cases), andas discussed above, the generated simulator seems effectivein supporting test automation for fault detection. Because this is very time consuming, we however did so only onfive RTES. One important question is whether our simulationrules are complete enough to simulate the environmentof any RTES. To address this possible limitation,the industrial cases and artificial problems that we selectedwere from diverse domains. One case was of an automatedbottle recycling system and the other was a marine seismicacquisition system. Both the case studies involve controloriented, embedded software, which we believe are themost suitable target applications of our methodology. Twoof the artificial problems that we developed depicted thecommon scenarios of RTES interactions with sensors inthe environment. The third artificial problem was selectedfrom the domain of train control systems.

The third UML-RT State Machine, which we have obtained from one of our industrial partners, models interactions be- tween a user and a phone. It has more than 100 states, which are nested up to the sixth level. In the simplified model (the second UML-RT State Machine in Table 2) some of the tran- sitions are disabled using contradictory guards, so parts of the UML-RT State Machine are not reachable.	mobile_app	As presented, the prototype implementation performs the analysis of the subset of UML-RT State Machines, but it has some limitations. One of them is inherited from the Choco solver [1], which cannot solve arbitrary complex con- straints, but for straightforward relations between variables the performance is acceptable. The other limitation is the result of the exploration in Algorithm 1, which may limit the scalability. However, the presented technique, besides using symbolic values to aggregate states, is applied to a single state machine, so the analysis is performed on the unit level. As illustrated by the above case studies, the technique can be applied to analyze non-trivial UML-RT State Machines. The general applicability of the method to industrial models is future work and will directly depend on the nature of the action code used in these models. # Apart from the future work already mentioned, more work is required to determine the applicability of the technique to industrial-size UML-RT models. If performance or function- ality improvements become necessary we plan to use aggre- gation of states that go beyond data values. Finally, work allowing for the symbolic analysis of collections of capsules by combining symbolic execution trees is currently ongoing. # In the presented mapping of UML-RT State Machines not all available fea- tures are considered. For instance, we omit history states or internal transitions. Although these are important model- ing elements, their treatment is not essential in the presented approach. The support for these elements is left for future work. # The general applicability of the method to industrial models is future work and will directly depend on the nature of the action code used in these models.

INDUSTRIAL_EXAMPLE	"The ÔInception PhaseÕ activity[ represents the context of this process (i.e., container for all processÕs activities). This is indicated by the start-blob in the top-left corner. It is used to coordinate between different processÕs activities and WorkProducts. The ÔMÕ letter is used to indicate that the activity is machine-executable (H for Human execution). One important aspect is the use of CallBehaviorActions in order to initiate/call processÕs activities (e.g., ÔElaborate Analysis ModelÕ call). In the call, one has to precise (1) whether the call is synchronous (use of a complete arrow in the top-left corner) or asynchronous (half arrow, e.g., ÔConstruction PhaseÕ call); (2) the parameters of the call, which represent WorkProducts inputs/outputs of the activity. Another aspect is the use of Decision and Merge nodes. The Decision Node allows for the expression of a choice of actions to perform depending on a condition (in this case, if the analysis model is valid or not). Conditions have to be expressed on activity edges (i.e., object flows) and will be evaluated at runtime. The merge node here is used to express that the ÔElaborate Analysis modelÕ activity may be triggered by one of the two possibilities. The first one is when the ÔInception PhaseÕ activity is launched. The second one is when the analysis model validation fails."	business_process	A larger evaluation of the use of UML4SPM in production stages is underway. In the context of process modeling, an important perspective of this work is the definition of the set of activities and constraints that would allow a process definition to be modified at runtime and without restarting the process execution i.e., preserving the process state.

Therefore, tank 2 needs always a certain amount of water which it can get from tank 1.	controller	"Currently, ModelicaML only supports the specification of timing behavior in a rudimentary way. Therefore, we do not specify discrete timing behavior in our protocol. As a result it is difficult to grasp the timing behavior of the dis- crete controller and the communication protocol. This can be seen within the sequence diagram, because several mes- sages that are sent one after another have the same time of sending. # Currently, we work on a new version of our translation directly to the StateGraph2 library. We want to combine StateGraph2 with algorithmic code for constructs which depend on a particular order of execution. Translating to StateGraph2 has the advantage that the resulting models are structured similarly to the ModelicaML state machines and are, thus, easier to understand by the developer than the generated Modelica code. Though, we have to extend the StateGraph2 library to support message sending and receiving for that translation. Furthermore, we want to add more syntactical con- structs to ModelicaML state machines for the better spec- ification of temporal behavior. Specifically, clocks, time guards and invariants as used in timed automata will be added to ModelicaML state machines. Finally, we want to translate simulation runs done in a Modelica tool back to ModelicaML. For example, the states and transitions which are taken during a simulation run can be appropriately vi- sualized using sequence diagrams."

However, more planning and analysis must be conducted. The modelingof complex concurrency aspects over threads, and the model composition ofSystemC threads, and POSIX C threads through automated interfaces is stilla challenging issue.In the future, we aim also at identifying characteristics of reusable modeltransformations and ways of achieving reuse by collecting in a library preciseabstraction/refinement transformation patterns according to the levels of abstraction:functional, TLM, behavioral, BCA, and RTL. In particular, we arefocusing on the TLM level to model the communication aspects at a certainnumber of TLM sublevels according to the OSCI TLM standard [OSCI group2008]. We believe the use of fine-grained transformations that are being composed(chaining) would be beneficial, both increasing the productivity and thequality of the developed systems.Recently [Gargantini et al. 2008b; Carioni et al. 2008], we are also tacklingthe problem of formally analyzing UML visual models. We aim at complementingthe proposed design methodology with a formal analysis processfor high-level system validation and verification (V&V), which involves the abstractstate machine (ASM) [B¬orger and St¬ark 2003] formal method. Our overall goal is to provide a design environmentwhere both the application software and the hardware architectureare described together by a multiviews UML model representing the mappingof the functionality (of the application software) onto an architecture. Moreover,through a formal analysis process the system components can be functionallyvalidated and verified early at high-levels of abstraction, and even in a transparentway (i.e., no strong skills and expertise on formal methods are requiredto the user) by the use of the ASM formal method and supporting analysistools"	F_additional_analysis # F_reusability		P41	30	P42	A330	both	A	ACM	N/A	N/A	A	Performance evaluation of UML2-modeled embedded streaming applications with system-level simulation	Tero Arpinen, Erno Salminen, Timo D.

EXAMPLE	 process of managing anomalies detected during software testing and operation.	business_process	If a modeler does not provide all the necessary information in state diagrams, the code produced by the automatic translation will not be complete. However, the modeler is always free to edit the code produced by the translator, thus changing or adding the features of the process as desired. # Up to now we did not consider modeling the interface with the human agents and/or the development tools used in the process (i.e., the elements appearing in the upper part of Figure 1). Sometimes it could be interesting to model in UML such interfaces (e.g., to describe the behavior of a tool, which messages it generates under what conditions, etc.). However this is not a central issue as long as tools are _generally give, not developed specifically for the  process. In any case the implementationof tools is quite different from the enactment of processes: for tool development the traditional usage of UML is perfectly suited.

Each simulation is run for a length of 10,000, which generates 1929 jobs. The results obtained from the two simulations are compared	SET_OF_EXAMPLES	"To illustrate how the UML can be used to design a system which may be simulated, let us consider a simple queuing system where jobs arrive into the system randomly with some probability distribution every certain interval. The jobs are then placed into a queue before being processed by a server. The server takes a certain time to process each job before the job is completed. The performance data consists of the time taken for a job to be completed. By keeping track of how many jobs are completed and the total time spent by these jobs in the system, we can work out the average response time"	synthetic	"The UML tool that we have constructed can beimproved in several ways. First, the class diagramcan be utilised more to allow the random propertiesof the static objects to be specified. This can beachieved by attaching a ÒnoteÓ to the appropriateclass. The associations between the classes can alsobe used to indicate the multiplicity of the objectsinvolved in the system. This is useful, for example, toevaluate the effect of adding another server toprocess a queue."

For example, we need a script language for the configuration of DOBS, where parts of the configuration can be placed directly in the specification. Attributes shall be assigned with drawing objects, where e.g. a lamp attribute is displayed as a lamp and not as a text which says true or false. Another current project is a topology editor. E.g. a track-based production system may be plugged together in an editor offering track icons. This topology will be trans- lated into graph rewrite rules to create initial starting object structures for the simulation afterwards. 	F_platform_improvement # F_expressiveness		P63	52
